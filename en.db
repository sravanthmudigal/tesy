    [i]Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.[/i]

    [br]
    When inet_interfaces specifies just one IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is not a loopback address,
     the Postfix SMTP client will use this address as the IP source address for outbound mail.[br]
     Support for IPv6 is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.[br]

    On a multi-homed firewall with separate Postfix instances listening on the "inside" and "outside" interfaces,
    this can prevent each instance from being able to reach servers on the "other side" of the firewall.
    [br]A better solution for multi-homed firewalls is to leave inet_interfaces at the default value and instead use explicit IP addresses in the master.cf[br]
    SMTP server definitions.
    [br]This preserves the Postfix SMTP client's loop detection, by ensuring that each side of the firewall knows that 
    the other IP address is still the same host.[br]
     Setting $inet_interfaces to a single IPv4 and/or IPV6 address is primarily useful with virtual hosting of domains on secondary IP addresses,
     when each IP address serves a different domain (and has a different $myhostname setting).[br]

SMTP Connection caching is a performance feature.[br]
Whether or not it actually improves performance depends on the conditions
[ul]
[li]SMTP Connection caching can greatly improve performance when delivering mail to a destination with multiple mail servers, because it can help Postfix to skip over a non-responding server.[/li]
[li]Otherwise, the benefits of SMTP connection caching are minor: it eliminates the latency of the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK), plus the latency of the SMTP initial handshake (220 greeting, EHLO command, EHLO response).[/li]
[li]SMTP Connection caching gives no gains with respect to SMTP session tear-down. The Postfix sender process normally does not wait for the server's reply to the QUIT command, and it never waits for the TCP final handshake to complete.[/li]
[li]SMTP Connection caching introduces some overhead: the client needs to send an RSET command to find out if a connection is still usable, before it can send the next MAIL FROM command[/li]
[/ul]
 When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the sending process does not disconnect after a mail transaction, but gives the connection to the scache 
 server which keeps the connection open for a limited amount of time.[br]
After handing over the open connection to the scache server, the sender process continues with some other mail delivery request.[br]
Meanwhile, any sender process can ask the scache server for that cached connection and reuse it for mail delivery.[br]
The connection cache can be searched by destination domain name and by the IP address of the host at the other end of the connection.[br]
This allows Postfix to reuse a connection even when the remote host is mail server for domains with different names. 
[h4] The Postfix sender process supports two connection caching strategies[/h4]
[ul]
[li][strong]On-demand connection caching.[/strong]
 This is enabled by default.[br]
 When this feature is enabled, the Postfix sender process automatically saves a connection to the connection cache when a destination has a high volume of mail in the active queue. 
[br][/li]
[li][strong]Per-destination connection caching.[/strong][br]
This is enabled by explicitly listing specific destinations.[br]
After completing delivery to a selected destination, the Postfix sender process [i]always[/i] saves the connection to the connection cache

The timer starts when the connection is initiated (i.e. it includes the connect, greeting and helo latency, in addition to the latencies of subsequent mail delivery transactions).[br]
This feature addresses a performance stability problem with remote SMTP servers.
[br]This problem is not specific to Postfix: [i]it can happen when any MTA sends large amounts of SMTP email to a site that has multiple MX hosts.[/i][br]
The problem starts when one of a set of MX hosts becomes slower than the rest.[br]
Even though SMTP clients connect to fast and slow MX hosts with equal probability, the slow MX host ends up with more simultaneous inbound connections than the faster MX hosts, 
because the slow MX host needs more time to serve each client request.[br]
[strong]The slow MX host becomes a connection attractor.[/strong]If one MX host becomes N times slower than the rest, it dominates mail delivery 
latency unless there are more than N fast MX hosts to counter the effect.[br]
And if the number of MX hosts is smaller than N, the mail delivery latency becomes effectively that of the slowest MX host divided by the total number of MX hosts.[br]
The solution uses connection caching by limiting the amount of time during which a connection can be used repeatedly (instead of limiting the number of deliveries over that connection),
 Postfix not only restores fairness in the distribution of simultaneous connections across a set of MX hosts, it also favors deliveries over connections 
 that perform well, which is exactly what we want.[br]
The default reuse time limit, [code]300s[/code], is comparable to the various smtp transaction timeouts which are fair estimates of maximum excess 
latency for a slow delivery.[br][i]Note that hosts may accept thousands of messages over a single connection within the default connection reuse time limit.[/i][br]
This number is much larger than the limit of 10 messages per cached connection.[br]
it may prove necessary to lower the limit to avoid interoperability issues with MTAs that exhibit bugs when many messages are delivered via a single connection.

[li]The [strong]"default destination concurrency limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 20) controls how many messages may be sent to the same destination simultaneously.[br]
 You can override this setting for specific message delivery transports by taking the name of the master.cf entry and appending "_destination_concurrency_limit".[br]
[/ul]
Examples of transport specific concurrency limits are:
[ul]
[li]The [strong]"local destination concurrency limit"[/strong] parameter (default: 2) controls how many messages are delivered simultaneously to the same local recipient.
[br]The recommended limit is low because delivery to the same mailbox must happen sequentially, so massive parallelism is not useful.[br]
Another good reason to limit delivery concurrency to the same recipient:[br] if the recipient has an expensive shell command in her .forward file, 
or if the recipient is a mailing list manager, you don't want to run too many instances of those processes at the same time.[/li]
[li]The default [strong]"smtp destination concurrency limit"[/strong] of 20 seems enough to noticeably load a system without bringing it to its knees.[br]
Be careful when changing this to a much larger number.[/li][/ul]
The above default values of the concurrency limits work well in a broad range of situations.[br]
Knee-jerk changes to these parameters in the face of congestion can actually make problems worse.[br]
Specifically, large destination concurrencies should never be the default.[br]
They should be used only for transports that deliver mail to a small number of high volume domains.[br]
A common situation where high concurrency is called for is on gateways relaying a high volume of mail from between the Internet and an intranet mail environment.[br]
Approximately half the mail (assuming equal volumes inbound and outbound) will be destined for the internal mail hubs.[br]
Since the internal mail hubs will be receiving all external mail exclusively from the gateway, 
it is reasonable to configure the gateway to make greater demands on the capacity of the internal SMTP servers.[br]
The tuning of the inbound concurrency limits need not be trial and error.[br]
 A high volume capable mailhub should be able to easily handle 50 or 100 (rather than the default 20) simultaneous connections, 
 especially if the gateway forwards to multiple MX hosts.[br]
When all MX hosts are up and accepting connections in a timely fashion, throughput will be high.[br]
If any MX host is down and completely unresponsive, the average connection latency rises to at least 1/N * $smtp_connection_timeout, if there are N MX hosts.[br]
This limits throughput to at most the destination concurrency * N / "smtp connection timeout".
[br]For example, with a destination concurrency of 100 and 2 MX hosts, each host will handle up to 50 simultaneous connections.[br]
If one MX host is down and the default SMTP connection timeout is 30s, the throughput limit is [code]100 * 2 / 30 ~= 6[/code] messages per second.[br]
This suggests that high volume destinations with good connectivity and multiple MX hosts need a lower connection timeout, values as low as [code]5s[/code] or even [code]1s[/code]
can be used to prevent congestion when one or more, but not all MX hosts are down.[br]
If necessary, set a higher "transport destination concurrency limit" and a lower "smtp connection timeout" 
(with a "-o" override in master.cf since this parameter has no per-transport name) for the relay transport and any transports dedicated for specific high volume destinations.";s:25:"title_postfix_tuning_text";s:106:"The hints and tips in this document help you improve the performance of Postfix systems that already work.";s:11:"TLS_EXPLAIN";s:966:"[b]Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security[/b][br]SMTP servers and clients normally communicate in the clear over the Internet.[br]
In many cases, this communication goes through one or more router that is not controlled or trusted by either entity.[br]
Such an untrusted router might allow a third party to monitor or alter the communications between the server and client.[br]
Further, there is often a desire for two SMTP agents to be able to authenticate each others` identities.[br]
For example, a secure SMTP server might only allow communications from other SMTP agents it knows, or it might act differently for messages received from an agent it knows than from one it doesn't know.[br]

If a Windows client doesn't have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time.[br]
POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory.[br]
As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file.[br]
With this parameter set (the default) then Samba checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without
actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it.[br]
This is not perfect, as it's possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly,
but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour.[br]
Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case.[br]
If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn't check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open.[br]
If the user doesn't have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is 
too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user.[br]

 most mail server software can be configured to reject or flag messages which have been sent from a site listed on one or more such lists.[br]
"DNSBL" is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy.[br]
There are dozens of DNSBLs in existence,[1][2] which use a wide array of standards for listing and delisting of addresses.[br]
These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, listing the addresses of ISPs who willingly host spammers, or listing addresses which have sent spam to a honeypot system.[br]
Since the creation of the first DNSBL in 1997, the operation and policies of these lists have been frequently controversial, both in Internet advocacy and occasionally in lawsuits. Many mail system operators and users consider DNSBLs a valuable tool to share information about spam sources, but others including prominent Internet activists have objected to them as a form of censorship. In addition, a small number of DNSBL operators have been the target of lawsuits filed by spammers seeking to have the lists shut down.

 WCCP is a dynamic service in which a cache engine communicates to a router about it's status,

  This means that if your cache becomes unavailable, 
  the router will automatically stop attempting to forward traffic to it and end users will 
  not be affected (and likely not even notice that your cache is out of service).[br]
  For WCCP to work, you firstly need to configure your Squid Cache, and additionally configure the host OS to redirect the HTTP traffic from port 80 to whatever port your Squid box is listening to the traffic on.

 Sets the size of the shared memory buffer pool — that is, the cache.[br]
 The cache should be the size of the normal working data set of the application, 
 with some small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.[br]
 (Note: the working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and is usually 
 much larger.)[br]
The value specified for this parameter is the maximum value that your application will be able to use for your in-memory cache. If your application does not have enough data to fill up the amount of space specified here, then your application will only use the amount of memory required by the data that your application does have.
For the DB, the default cache size is 8MB.[br]
You cannot specify a cache size value of less than 100KB.[br]
Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% to account for cache overhead;
 cache sizes larger than 500MB are used as specified.[br]
 The maximum size of a single cache is 4GB on 32-bit systems and 10TB on 64-bit systems.[br]
 (All sizes are in powers-of-two, that is, 256KB is 2^18 not 256,000.)[br]
It is possible to specify cache sizes large enough they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.[br]
 For example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated contiguously by a 
 process.[br]
If ncache is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.[br]
If it is greater than 1, the cache will be split across ncache separate regions, where the region size 
is equal to the initial cache size divided by ncache.[br]
The cache size supplied to this parameter will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the region size and 
may not be larger than the maximum possible cache size configured for your application 
(use the set_cache_max to do this).[br]
The ncache parameter is ignored when resizing the cache.
The syntax of this parameter is a single line with the string one or more whitespace characters, 
and the initial cache size specified in three parts: the gigabytes of cache, the additional bytes of cache,and the number of caches, also separated by whitespace characters.

How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed to preempt delivery of one message with another.[br]
Each transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message.[br]
One message can be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery slots (i.e., invocations of delivery agents) than the current message counter has accumulated (or will eventually accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often is the counter incremented - it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.[br]
The cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely.[br]
The minimum value the scheduling algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput rate.[br]
Although there is no maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.[br]
The only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the delivery of mailing-list mail.[br]
In the worst case, their delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost) and (cost/cost-1) times more than if the preemptive scheduler was disabled.[br]
The default value of 5 turns out to provide reasonable message response times while making sure the mailing-list deliveries are not extended by more than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.

 typically to improve storage utilization.[br]
 In the deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored, along with references to the unique copy of data.[br]
 Deduplication is able to reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored.[br]
Data deduplication increases the speed of service and reduces costs.[br]
The benefits from data deduplication start with increasing overall data integrity and end with reducing overall data protection costs.[br]
Data deduplication lets users reduce the amount of disk they need for backup by 90 percent or more, and with reduced acquisition costs-and reduced power, space, and cooling requirements.[br]
Deduplication can also provide significant energy, space, cooling and costs savings, by reducing the amount of data stored. It contributes significantly in the process of Data Center Transformation through reducing carbon footprints due to savings on storage space and reduces the recurring cost of human resource to management and administration.[br]

appropriate for your setup/server.[br]
Each time a request on an item can be found in the cache (cache hits), this avoids calls to other processes and disks/storage.[br]
Setting sensible cache settings certainly increases the performance.[br]
In a server purely running Zarafa, it is advisable to set caches to use around 80% (in total -- including MySQL) 
of the RAM available in your server and can be considered to be a rule-of-thumb.[br]
The other 20% should be free for system processes, other processes (like your MTA) and the web server.[br]
Whenever you set the values too high this can result in the use of swap on your server.[br]
Swapping should be avoided, but we do want to make use of the RAM available.[br]
Therefore these settings should be a healthy balance between the risk of swapping and efficient caching in memory.

This is the main cache used in Zarafa.[br]
It caches all data that comes into view in tables (e.g. the view of your inbox, or any other folder).[br]
In an ideal situation, all cells would be cached, so that the database does not need to be queried 
for data when browsing through folders, but this would require around 1.5K per message item (email, appointment task, etc) 
in the entire server.[br]
If you can afford it, set this value as high as possible, up to 50% of your total RAM capacity.

It is difficult to know when this should be changed, other than by experimentation.[br]The slabtop command (part of the package procps) shows top memory objects used 
by the kernel.[br]The vfs caches are the "dentry" and the "*_inode_cache" objects.[br]
If these are consuming a large amount of memory in relation to pagecache, it may be worth trying to increase pressure.[br]
Could also help to reduce swapping. The default value is 100. ";s:18:"vm.min_free_kbytes";s:355:"
Sets the value of each page’s zone to min, low, or high, depending on themachine.[br]
Default is 724.[br]

Example: For a machine with more than 8GByte RAM you can easily spare 128MByte (which would translate into a sysctl value of 131072, as it has to be given in kByte).
";s:15:"vm.nr_hugepages";s:189:"

";s:19:"vm.overcommit_ratio";s:1233:"
Percentage of memory that is allowed for overcommit.[br]Default is 50.[br]
It represents the percentage of physical RAM that along with the entire swap forms the total address space (allocatable memory).[br]
Yes, the naming is confusing, since there is no overcommitting.[br]
The default is 50 so, quite unintuitively, only half of the RAM will be used.[br]
Seeing that the swap is the only component that can change dynamically it would have made sense to specify a percentage for that.[br]
Anyway, there are 2 ways to ensure that the allocatable memory will be equal to the RAM size:[br]
1. make the swap the same size as the RAM and set vm.overcommit_ratio=0 - that will work as long as the swap is in use, 
but as soon as a swapoff is done (manually or during shutdown), you're in for a nasty surprise: no more memory can be allocated.[br]
At all! New programs will fail to start.[br][br]
2. Set vm.overcommit_ratio=100 and disable the swap.[br]
This is a stable setup and the preferred method on a machine with enough RAM.[br]
Web servers are slowed down anyway by swapping and careful planning will help ensuring that the memory 
usage limits won't be reached (by setting cache sizes, maximum number of processes, etc.).
[br]
";s:20:"vm.overcommit_memory";s:481:"
Processes commonly allocate memory by calling the function malloc().[br]
The kernel decides if enough RAM is available and either grants or denies the allocation request.[br]
Linux (and a few other Unix-variants) support the ability to over-commit memory; that is, to permit more memory to be allocated than is available 
in physical RAM plus swap.[br]
This is scary, but sometime necessary since applications commonly allocate memory for "worst case" scenarios but never use it.
";s:13:"vm.swappiness";s:143:"
Determines how likely the VM subsystem is to swap to disk.[br]
Default is 60 and typically is sufficient. [br]
Valid values are 0 to 100.[br]
";s:24:"vm.lower_zone_protection";s:377:"
If running the 32-bit hugemem kernel isn't an option either, you can try
setting to a value of 250 or more.[br]
This will cause the kernel to try to be more aggressive in defending the
low zone from allocating memory that could potentially be allocated in
the high memory zone.[br]Some experimentation to find the best setting
for your environment will probably be necessary.

If you want to test charts and graphs generated by Artica with not many users, you can click on the "I understand,continue anyway" button.[br]
In this case this warning will disappear and the statistics engine will continue to run.[br]
[br]
[b]Second is to disable the Artica statistics engine.[/b][br][br]
By clicking on the button "Stop Artica Statistics engine", the MySQL database will be cleaned and the statistics engine will be stopped and the statistics section 
will disappear.[br]
Before clicking on the button visits links below in order to enable reduced statistics by using the Sarg software and generate CSV logs files.[br]
[br][br]
[b]Third is to use a remote server for statistics generation.[/b][br][br]
The Artica Proxy statistics appliance is designed to unload proxies statistics and Web filtering tasks.[br]
This appliance will be in charge to centralize statistics for several proxies.[br]
It designed to provide centralized Antivirus and Web filtering services.[br]

[br]Each zarafa-server instance in a multi-server setup needs it's own zarafa-search service.[br]
When searching for a particular mail, the required time to find the requested emails will be seriously reduced.

SPNEGO is used when a client application wants to authenticate to a remote server,
but neither end is sure what authentication protocols the other supports.[br]
The pseudo-mechanism uses a protocol to determine what common GSSAPI mechanisms are available, 
selects one and then dispatches all further security operations to it.[br]

This parameter determines whether or not smbclient and other samba components acting as a client will attempt

If enabled, Samba can attempt to use Kerberos to contact servers known only by IP address.[br]
Kerberos relies on names, so ordinarily cannot function in this situation.[br]
If disabled, Samba will use the name used to look up the server when asking the KDC for a ticket.[br]
This avoids situations where a server may impersonate another, soliciting authentication as one principal 
while being known on the network as another.[br]

A captive portal turns a Web browser into an authentication device.[br]

and tries to access the web.[br]
At that time the browser is redirected to a web page which may require authentication and/or payment, 
or simply display an acceptable use policy and require the user to agree.[br]
Captive portals are used at many Wi-Fi hotspots, and can be used to control wired access (e.g. apartment houses, hotel rooms, business centers, 
"open" Ethernet jacks) as well.[br]
Since the login page itself must be presented to the client, either that login page is 
locally stored in the gateway, or the web server hosting that page must be "whitelisted" 
via a walled garden to bypass the authentication process.[br]
Depending on the feature set of the gateway, multiple web servers can be whitelisted (say for iframes or links within the login page).[br]
In addition to whitelisting the URLs of web hosts, some gateways can whitelist TCP ports.[br]
The MAC address of attached clients can also be set to bypass the login process.[br]

for example  you cannot run the Proxy Server in the management Network to use it for web redirection in the production Network.[br]

First of all you have to create two ACLs , with the first ACL you tell the ASA who and where is (are) 
the Artica Caching Proxy Sever, You can name this ACL "wccp-server" :[br]
Our ASA as 172.16.1.254 IP address, Artica proxy server as  172.16.1.100 IP address, clients network is 172.16.1.0/224
[br][code]access-list wccp-server extended permit ip host 172.16.1.100 any[/code][br]
With the other ACL you declare the clients and the traffic which should be intercepted.[br]
But off course you have to remove the proxy server from the client ACL:[br]
[code]access-list wccp-traffic line 1 extended deny ip host 172.16.8.100 any[br]
access-list wccp-traffic line 2 extended permit tcp ip 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 any eq www[/code][br]

The Ident Protocol (Identification Protocol, IDENT), specified in RFC 1413, is an Internet protocol that helps identify the user of a particular TCP connection.[br]
The Identification daemon allows you to identify your users based on log in name.[br]
This simplifies management so you don't have to go around matching IP addresses to computers.[br]
Of course it also allows you to add users to groups based on their username.[br]
Using this feature for user authentication has several benefits over the SSL or proxy login methods.[br]
Primarily that the user does not need to enter username and password credentials to access trough Internet.[br]
Instead, an Ident service running on the client system will automatically provide the Windows username to the proxy.[br]

The recommended extra RAM besides what is used by proxy is used by the operating system to improve disk I/O performance and 
by other applications or services running on the server.[br]
If you have a low memory server, and a large disk, then you will not necessarily be able to use all the disk space, 
since as the cache fills the memory available will be insufficient, forcing proxy to swap out memory and affecting performance.[br]
A very large cache on disk total and insufficient physical RAM + Swap could cause proxy to stop functioning completely.[br]

LDAP sign and seal can be controlled with the registry key[br]

Setting this option causes server to claim a special domain specific NetBIOS name that  identifies it as a domain master browser for its given workgroup.[br]
Local master browsers in the same workgroup on broadcast-isolated subnets will give this server their local browse lists, and then ask shared server
for a complete copy of the browse list for the  whole wide area network.
[br]Browser clients will then contact their local master browser, and will receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list for their broadcast-isolated subnet.[br]
Note that Windows NT Primary Domain Controllers expect to be able to claim this workgroup specific special NetBIOS name that identifies
them as domain master browsers for that workgroup by default (i.e. there is no way to prevent a Windows NT PDC from attempting to do this).[br]

When this is set the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file 
is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file
 is created or extended to be a given size.[br]
In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.[br]
This can be slow on some systems.[br]
When you work with large files like >100MB or so you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.[br]
When you have an extent based filesystem it's likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba
 to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate.[br]
 With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas.[br]
 Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.[br]
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents.[br]
On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will 
see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files.[br]
Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems

Apache can be configured in both a forward and reverse proxy mode.[br]
An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server.[br]
In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target 
and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.[br]
The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.[br]
A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall

The DHCP server will normally assume that the configuration information about a given network segment is not known to be correct 
and is not authoritative.[br]
This is so that if a naive user installs a DHCP server not fully understanding how to configure it,
 it does not send spurious DHCPNAK messages to clients that have obtained addresses from a legitimate DHCP server on the network.[br]
Network administrators setting up authoritative DHCP servers for their networks should always use authoritative to indicate that the DHCP server should 
send DHCPNAK messages to misconfigured clients.[br]
If this is not done, clients will be unable to get a correct IP address after changing subnets until their old lease has expired, 
which could take quite a long time.[br]
However, if a DHCP server is to be set up so that it is aware of some networks for which it is authoritative and 
some networks for which it is not, it may be more appropriate to declare authority on a per-network-segment basis.[br]
Note that the most specific scope for which the concept of authority makes any sense is the physical network segment 
- either a shared-network statement or a subnet statement that is not contained within a shared-network statement[↓r]
It is not meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some subnets within a shared network, 
but not authoritative for others, nor is it meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some 
host declarations and not others.

 It waits for a second, and if no ICMP Echo response has been heard, it assigns the address.[br]
 If a response is heard, the lease is abandoned, and the server does not respond to the client.[br]
This ping check introduces a default one-second delay in responding to DHCPDISCOVER messages,
which can be a problem for some clients.[br]
The default delay of one second may be configured using the ping-timeout parameter.[br].

The idea behind soft limits is to allow control groups to use as much of the memory as needed, provided
[br]
a. There is no memory contention[br]
b. They do not exceed their hard limit[br]
[br]
When the system detects memory contention or low memory, control groups
are pushed back to their soft limits.[br]If the soft limit of each control
group is very high, they are pushed back as much as possible to make
sure that one control group does not starve the others of memory.[br]
Please note that soft limits is a best effort feature, it comes with
no guarantees, but it does its best to make sure that when memory is
heavily contended for, memory is allocated based on the soft limit

[ul]
[li]Intercepting HTTP breaks TCP/IP standards because user agents think they are talking directly to the origin server.[/li]
[li]Requires IPv4 with NAT.[/li]
[li]It causes path-MTU (PMTUD) to fail, possibly making some remote sites inaccessible.[br] This is not usually a problem if your client machines are connected via Ethernet or DSL PPPoATM where the MTU of all links between the cache and client is 1500 or more. If your clients are connecting via DSL PPPoE then this is likely to be a problem as PPPoE links often have a reduced MTU (1472 is very common).[/li]
[li]On older IE versions before version 6, the ctrl-reload function did not work as expected.[/li]
[li]Proxy authentication does not work, and IP based authentication conceptually fails because the users are all seen to come from the Proxy own IP address.[/li]
[li]You can't use IDENT lookups (which are inherently very insecure anyway).[/li]
[li]Transparent mode only supports the HTTP protocol, not gopher, SSL, or FTP. You cannot setup a redirection-rule to the proxy server for other protocols other than HTTP since it will not know how to deal with it.[/li]
[li]Transparent mode are incompatible with IP filtering designed to prevent address spoofing.[/li]
[li]Clients are still expected to have full Internet DNS resolving capabilities; in certain intranet/firewalling setups, this is not always wanted.[/li]
[li]Related to above: suppose the users browser connects to a site which is down. However, due to the transparent proxying, it gets a connected state to the interceptor[br]The end user may get wrong error messages or a hung browser, for seemingly unknown reasons to them.[/li]

In 3.1, it is a plugin, loaded by default in the file v310.pre.[br]
The AWL is actually a very simple system.[BR]
In short, the AWL is a score averaging system.[BR]
It keeps track of the historical average of a sender, and pushes any subsequent mail towards that average.[br]
So if someone that never sent you mail before sends you a mail that scores 20, and then sends you a second mail that would score 2.0 without the AWL,
the AWL will push the score up to 11 on the second mail.[br]
This is auto blacklisting, based on their past history of spam.[br]
If that same person sent you a mail that scored 0, and then later sent one that scored 7,
the AWL would push the score down to 3.5.[br]
This is auto-whitelisting based on past history of nonspam.[br]
A "sender" is identified using both the address they sent with, and their IP address, so spam claiming to be From you with forged headers will fail to get through.[br]
But the "auto whitelist" isn't really a whitelist per-se. [br]

[br]
[H5]Discrimination[/H5]
Discrimination based greylisting is only usefull if you DO NOT want to greylist everybody.
[br]There may be several reasons for this.[br]
For example it can be used as a soft transistion to start greylisting, slowly  over time  making it more and more restrictive. [br]
Or it can help you convince management to allow you to do greylisting by explaining that you'd only greylist "anything suspicous" and thus, not your own  customers.
[br]

[H5]Discrimination - what is it?[/H5]

This feature was pretty hard to find a name for, but discrimination describes pretty well what it does. It discriminates ;).

I think of it as "the airport principle".[br] Everybody is let onto the plane UNLESS they find you suspicous.
You might have long hair,wear a turban, have dark skin or simply wearing a t-shirt saying  "explosive" or "GNU rocks".
[br]Then you will, by discrimination, be held back for further analysis. (im not saying it fair, its just a very good example)
[br]
The same principle applies here.
[br]Everyone is whitelisted UNLESS they look suspicous.[br]
If so, they have to go through greylisting.[br]
What is suspicous is defined in the discrimination.regexp file.[br]
In here one defines regular expression that will be used to check different attributes.[br]
[br][br]
Example:[br]
sender =~ @microsoft.com$
[br][br]
This line simply defines, that if the senders address ends on microsoft.com, its suspicous and thus will be greylisted.[br]
[br][br]
Another example:[br]
sender !~ ^(god|allah|jesus)@heaven.com$[br]
[br][br]
Note the !~ which means "anything that does NOT match, is suspicous".[br]
In this particular example we say: "We trust god, allah or jesus sending from heaven.com, but EVERYONE else will be greylisted."[br]

[br]
[H5]Rule Details[/H5]
The rules in /discrimination.regexp are defines by the following triplet:
[br]
[br]attribute comparison-operator regex[br]
[br]Valid comparison operators are:[br]
[br]=~ 	Equal to
[br]!~	Not Equal to
[br]
Valid attributes are anyhing sent from postfix to the policy deamon,but the ill explain the most common (and usefull) here:
[ul]
[li]sender		= the From address (from MAIL FROM:)[/li]
[li]recipient	= the recipients mail address (from RCPT TO:)[/li]
[li]client_address	= IP address of the client[/li]
[li]client_name	= Reverse-dns name of the client[/li]
[li]helo_name	= The text entered as "helo text"[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
Valid regular expression are simply perl compatable regular expressions.[br]
(without the "/" in beginning and end).[br]
[br]
[H5]Configuration directive: discrimination add rule number[/H5]

enable adds the rule number of the rule that caused the greylisting to the end of the rejection text, like this:[br]
 [i]Greylisted for 5 minutes (2)[/i][br]
In this case, 2 means the second (valid) regular expression in the file,caused the greylisting.[br]
This feature is to allow the support department to help customers figure out why, if their mail gets greylisted.[br]

[br]
[H5]Rule tips[/H5]
Its hard to define what is worthy of another look, and its definently not a 100% solution. [br]
If you have the guts and/or oppotunity, you should go with normal greylisting.[br]
I look often at our maillog and by doing so, start to see patterns to what spam looks like.
[br]You should do the same to find out whats good for greylisting, but some general tips are:[br]
[ul]
[li]missing reverse-dns[/li]
[li]mails from microsoft, fbi, paypal, ebay and the likes[/li]
[li]NULL senders. (blank sender address)[/li]
[li]mailaddresses with special chars (eg. $ or *)[/li]
[/ul][br]
The first one takes alot of the trash. So does NULL senders, but be advised that NULL senders are also legaly used in bounce mails.[br]
[br]
[H5]Performance guidelines[/H5]

It doesnt take much to do this check if you keep your list of expressions within reasonable limits.
[br]Actually this feature should be a performance saver, as it takes away a bunch of sql load, depending on how much you discriminate.[br]
[br]

By default Optin/Optout is set to 'none'.[br]
SQLgrey will apply greylisting (with the default whitelisting and auto-whitelisting described in the HOWTO) to every message.
[br]

If Optin/Optout is set to either 'optin' or 'optout', SQLgrey will check four tables to decide if the greylisting must be used.[br]
These four tables are:
[ul]
[li]optin_domain[/li]
[li]optin_email[/li]
[li]optout_domain[/li]
[li]optout_email[/li]
[/ul]

They each have only one column with either a domain name or a full email address (stored as a VARCHAR(255)).
[br]
[br][i][b]the content of each of these table *MUST* be *lowercased*.[br] SQLgrey always use lowercased address internally and for
performance reasons won't ask the database to check for different cases.[/b][/i]
[br]
If 'optin' is used, SQLgrey will only greylist in two cases:
[ul]
[li]the domain is in optin_domain AND the address isn't in optout_email,[/li]
[li]the address is in optin_email.[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
If 'optout' is used, SQLgrey won't greylist in two cases:
[ul]
[li]the domain is in optout_domain AND the address isn't in optin_email,[/li]
[li]the address is in optout_email.[/li]
[/ul]
[br]
[b][i]
SQLgrey doesn't check if the 4 tables' content is consistent. [br]
For example you should make sure that an address isn't both in optin_email and optout_email which doesn't make sense (SQLgrey won't crash but its
behaviour can change between versions).[/i]
[/b]
[br][br]
[H5]Performance guidelines[/H5]
For maximum performance, you should use the method which will use the least table entries.[br]
If nearly all your users want greylisting, you'll have better performance with 'optout'. If all of them want it without exception, use 'none'.[br]

If the needs of your users change between domains, use one of the optin/out_domain tables to set defaults (depending on the optmethod) by domain and add exceptions in the optin/out_email tables. This will
lower the number of entries in the database and help with performance.
[br]
[br][H5]Long email addresses[/H5]

For portability, addresses are limited to 255 characters. If you have users with addresses of more than 255 characters,
you'll have to trim the addresses the same way SQLgrey does: simply take the 255 first characters of the address leaving the rest out.[br]
If you have several users with the same 255 first characters, then it won't work properly (obviously the last user modified will set the
behaviour for the group beginning with the same characters).[br] As addresses of this size are pretty uncommon, the risk of collisions is probably only theoric though.";s:15:"reconnect_delay";s:15:"reconnect delay";s:20:"reconnect_delay_text";s:43:"don't allow a reconnection before x minutes";s:22:"reject_early_reconnect";s:22:"Reject early reconnect";s:27:"reject_early_reconnect_text";s:78:"Default for early reconnection is the value affected to 'Reject first attempt'";s:20:"reject_first_attempt";s:20:"Reject first attempt";s:25:"reject_first_attempt_text";s:556:"SQLgrey can tell Postfix to:[br]

The first choice will prevent Postfix from spending time evaluating potentially expensive rules.[br]

Here's an overview of how it works.[br]
When a bounce is received, Mailman tries to extract two pieces of information from the message: the address of the member the message was intended for, and the severity of
the problem causing the bounce. The severity can be either hard or soft meaning either a fatal error occurred, or a transient error occurred.[br]
When in doubt, a hard severity is used.
If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then the bounce is usually discarded.[br]
Otherwise, each member is assigned a bounce score and every time we encounter a bounce from this member we increment the score.[br]
Hard bounces increment by 1 while soft bounces increment by 0.5.[br]
We only increment the bounce score once per day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from a member per day, their score will increase by only 1 for that day.[br]
When a member's bounce score is greater than the bounce score threshold, the subscription is disabled.[br]
Once disabled, the member will not receive any postings from the list until their membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list administrator or the user).
[br]However, they will receive occasional reminders that their membership has been disabled, and these reminders will include information about how to re-enable their membership.[br]
You can control both the number of reminders the member will receive and the frequency with which these reminders are sent.[br]
There is one other important configuration variable;[br] after a certain period of time -- during which no bounces from the member are received -- the bounce information is considered stale and discarded.
[br]Thus by adjusting this value, and the score threshold, you can control how quickly bouncing members are disabled.
[br]You should tune both of these to the frequency and traffic volume of your list";s:22:"bounce_processing_text";s:249:"Should Mailman perform automatic bounce processing?[br]

This value can be a floating point number.[br]
Each subscriber is assigned a bounce score, as a floating point number.[br]
Whenever Mailman receives a bounce from a list member, that member's score is incremented.[br]
Hard bounces (fatal errors) increase the score by 1, while soft bounces (temporary errors) increase the score by 0.5.[br]
Only one bounce per day counts against a member's score, so even if 10 bounces are received for a member on the same day, their score will increase by just 1.[br]
This variable describes the upper limit for a member's bounce score, above which they are automatically disabled, but not removed from the mailing list.";s:38:"bounce_unrecognized_goes_to_list_owner";s:42:"Bounce messages that failed to be detected";s:43:"bounce_unrecognized_goes_to_list_owner_text";s:1097:"Should Mailman send you, the list owner, any bounce messages that failed to be detected by the bounce processor?[br]
Yes  is recommended.[br]
While Mailman's bounce detector is fairly robust, it's impossible to detect every bounce format in the world.[br]
You should keep this variable set to Yes for two reasons: [br]
1) If this really is a permanent bounce from one of your members, you should probably manually remove them from your list, and
[br]2) you might want to send the message on to the Mailman developers so that this new format can be added to its known set.[br]
If you really can't be bothered, then set this variable to No and all non-detected bounces will be discarded without further processing.[br]
Note: This setting will also affect all messages sent to your list's -admin address.[br]
